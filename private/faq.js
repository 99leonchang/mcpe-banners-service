        question: "What is the deal with this new backend?",
        answer: "We want to provide our users with the best possible software. We are experimenting with a bunch of new features to speed up rendering of banners. We are still <b>free</b> and offer all the same features as before."
    },
    {
        question: "I heard that the new backend will break old URLs, is this true?",
        answer: "The new API will deprecate all old URLs. However, we will setup redirects from the old URLs to the new ones. This service will be offered until users have had the chance to upgrade to the new URL format. We wil publish more information on this as we approach a full release."
